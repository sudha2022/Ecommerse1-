To create an abstract class and understand the concept of inheritance
modifying the Ecommerce project to include 
inheritance. My Product class will now be abstract.
Here I created four classes which are Product, Apparel,Bath,Book and Shop
The private attributes of the Product class are made public by using CONSTRUCTORS,GETTERS and SETTERS
Created buy()method in the Product class
The Apparel Class – will inherit from Product Class
The Book Class – will inherit from Product Class
Shop class being the main Class called the methods and implemented the scanner class to get the user input and displaying all the details .
